# Artificial Intelligence - Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing code example

-Assumption:
You already understand the concept of Simulated Annealing

-Given formula (on python language):
f(x1,x2) = (4 - 2.1 * x1**2 + x1**4 / 3) * x1**2 + x1 * x2 + (-4 + 4 * x2**2) * x2**2

-Goal:
find the minimum value of x1 and x2

-Hint:
1. The given formula is on python language.
2. To ease you to understand the code, convert the given formula to normal form first.
3. ** is mean square, x1**2 mean x1 squared 2 (in case you never see it before)
4. To make sure the result, use wolframalpha (just google it) to see the minimum value of x1 and x2
5. Read Guide.txt for code's guide
